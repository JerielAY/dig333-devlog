###Milestone 3

The majority of Milestone 3 has been spent attempting to integrate image detection software into the exisitng preoject 
code bank. Initially I secured a few different scripts from various places online that all claimed to be iterations of 
image detection libraries. I then utilized my computer camera to test the capabilities of this software by sampling 
a variety of methods that allowed for the camera to be utilized as an object tracker. My attempts at this integration  
were challenging because both the image detection software and the color detection software were utilizing the same
camera interface but were not displaying simultaneously. Addtitionally once the integration was complete visually and both 
scripts were utilizing the same window to display results, the challenge became ensuring that the integrity of 
both scripts remained and that each script would carry out its task despite this integration. I struggled on this portion of the 
the exercise as it wasn't immediately clear to me which pieces of code needed to remain within the codebase 
to grant functionality. I also struggled with how to consolidate the functionality of the two filtering hubs given 
their disparate nature as well as the facts that the two filtering hubs were filtering on different image channels.
A problem that became more apparent to me as I realized there needed to be only one opening of the webcam to prevent 
the generation of two visual streams. Hitting this blocker, my next steps would be to work towards integrating 
spotify playback compatibility into the project to so that once the color indicator flag can be harvested
from the color tracking software. The playback functionality is readily avaliable.
