## Week 1

### Tom Igoe, Physicality and Conviviality 

In the TEDxBigApple video by Tom Igoe, Igoe describes the nature of physical computing and how a broadening of the physical computing landscape is accompanying a shift in computational culture. He describes how companies and creators are moving towards different models of innovation.  As a result of this shift a lot of major technologies are becoming open source, creators and innovators are flocking to maker spaces and companies are incentivized to make their products modifiable.

- Quote: "users download plans or buy them from their typical companies and add more value to the items their buying by customizing them".
- Comment: I think it's interesting that Igoe believes conusmers/creators are adding more value to the products by customizing them, typically large tech leaders don't encourage this kind of iteration on their products because of the demands it places on the companies devlopment methodologies (e.g. Apple and their developer regulations)
- Question: What are some ways that companies can effectively make this shift to allowing innovation to flow both ways?


## Week 2


### Internet of Shit, The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours
In the article by Internet of Shit, Internet of Shit describes the staggerng number of ways an increasingly IOT trending society could fail or create more problems than it solves. Internet of Shit gives a number of examples of this including the horror of in-app purchase possibly being incorporated into essential technologies like thermostats and refrigeration. Ultimately Internet of Shit believes some of these technologies have their place in the world however for them to be completely effective will require commitments from manufacturers that are not quite yet in place. 

### Sanjay Sarma, The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World 
In the article by Sanjay Sarma, Sarma addresses the widespread security concerns that have been associated with an increasingly connected society. Sarma breaks these concerns into 3 major issues: Agreement on system architecture, Development of open standards reflecting the best architectural choices, Creation of a “test bed” where best practices can be designed and perfected. He posits that as long as the main issues are addresed as IOT continues to develop, then the negative aspects of IOT can be reigned in.

- Quote: "our glorious future of flying cars and convenience was somehow switched out for umbrellas that tweet us when it’s going to rain, and a fridge that live streams its contents. How did the Jetsons become so lame?"
- Comment: I think it's interesting to consider how societal expectations influence the acceptance or rejection of certain technologies. And although its done in jest I think this is a piece of what Internet of Shit is getting at.
- Question: How can existing IOT technologies be made to conform retroactively to developing standards?


### Experiment 1: Taste the Power

1. ![IMG_9852](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51386595/153117848-9e258e1e-eda2-419b-b847-ca0386a2f2a4.jpg)

1. Most important: Though the design has changed and been updated over the years the basic way we use multimeters has remained the same over the years
1. Quiz question: What is the difference between an auto range meter and a manual range meter?

### Experiment 2: Abuse a Battery

1. Text, photos, notes

   - Using the water analogy, the narowness of a tank/pipe is resistance, water pressure is voltage, and the flow of the water is the currrent so: water pressure = flow *      narowness
  
   - Charge is measured in couloumbs, voltage in volts and current in Amperes
  
   -  3 differences between DC and AC are the direction the current flows in each, DC is not capable of traveling the long distances that AC is, Its easier to generate AC power than it is DC power
  
1. Quiz question: Why is it easier to generate AC power than it is DC power

### Experiment #3: Your First Circuit

1. Text, photos, etc.


![thumbnail_IMG_9853](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51386595/153123054-0045b6c1-13fa-42d1-8e2e-7b825dbff5be.jpg)


  - Its often easiest to read the bag when trying to determine resistance
  - When measuring the voltage through a basic circuit the multimeter reads about 4.7 volts, it reads about the same when the resistor is included in the circuit further verifying Ohm's law
  - There are numerous places along the circuit at which a voltage measurement can be taken
3. Most important: Always be careful when dealing with current 
4. Quiz question: Why does an LED burnout?

### Experiment #4

1. Text, photos, etc

  ![potentiometer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51386595/153124511-88536dde-01dd-42ce-8ac7-a398fcee0caa.jpg)

  - Polarity generally describes the directional flow of electrons from one pole to another
  - The current and voltage measurements throughout the components of the cirrcuit can all be related by measuring the resistance of the wires and utilinz mathematical calculations 
  - Ohm's law V = I * R
  - creating circuits in series or parallel affects the value of certain measurements in a circuit depending on the components being connected.
  - Circuits in series mean that if one unit of the circuit burns out the entire circuit will fail
4. Quiz question: How do you calculate total current in parallel?


## Week 4

### Phillip K Dick, Pay for the Printer
In Pay for the Printer by Phillip K Dick, Dick describes a world in which creating from scratch has become a rarity. A mysterious machine known as the Biltong(which has striking similarities to a 3d printer)is responsible for the development of all new items in the original. It accomplishes this by way of a process known as printing new copies from originals (or orignally made items/very realistic copies). By the end of the story, however, 2 of the main characters figure out that they can create the same items they need from scratch they just need to rebuild the architecture necessary to do so. Dick's story hints at the danger in futuristic processes like 3d printing where items possibly no longer have the same level of quality or end up requiring more labor in the long run to maintain.

### THE PRESERVING MACHINE

The main protagonist Doc Labyrinth fears for the safety of the fragile works of great value, particularly classical music, in the event of the apocalypse. Accordingly, he orders a machine to be built that will be able to convert musical scores into animals capable of surviving and defending themselves.

### THE PRESERVING MACHINE

- Quote:"I said good night and got into my car. It was pitch dark; nighthad fallen completely. I switched on my headlights and moved off down the road, driving into the utter darkness. There were no other cars in sight anywhere. I was alone, and very cold. "
- Comment: It was interesting the way that the main character described the music which ended up being produced by the preserving machine. The result seemed a bit anti-climatic given that entire protagonist main dreams and wishes were predicated on their abiity to replicate this high value music.
- Question: What does the symbol of the dung beetle mean in the context of this story?

- Quote:"I can't believe it. Where do you start? You have to have tools
to make this. It's a paradox!" His voice rose with hysteria. "It isn't possible!"
- Comment: I think it was interesting the way that Dick humanized the Biltong by extending the drama in the last scene as the people rushed the Biltong and it fought as hard as it could to preserve itself. 
- Question: Why did the people believe that the made item would be easier for the Biltong to make ?
