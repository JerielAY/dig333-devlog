## Week 1

### Tom Igoe, Physicality and Conviviality 

In the TEDxBigApple video by Tom Igoe, Igoe describes the nature of physical computing and how a broadening of the physical computing landscape is accompanying a shift in computational culture. He describes how companies and creators are moving towards different models of innovation.  As a result of this shift a lot of major technologies are becoming open source, creators and innovators are flocking to maker spaces and companies are incentivized to make their products modifiable.

- Quote: "users download plans or buy them from their typical companies and add more value to the items their buying by customizing them".
- Comment: I think it's interesting that Igoe believes conusmers/creators are adding more value to the products by customizing them, typically large tech leaders don't encourage this kind of iteration on their products because of the demands it places on the companies devlopment methodologies (e.g. Apple and their developer regulations)
- Question: What are some ways that companies can effectively make this shift to allowing innovation to flow both ways?


## Week 2


### Internet of Shit, The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours
In the article by Internet of Shit, Internet of Shit describes the staggerng number of ways an increasingly IOT trending society could fail or create more problems than it solves. Internet of Shit gives a number of examples of this including the horror of in-app purchase possibly being incorporated into essential technologies like thermostats and refrigeration. Ultimately Internet of Shit believes some of these technologies have their place in the world however for them to be completely effective will require commitments from manufacturers that are not quite yet in place. 

### Sanjay Sarma, The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World 
In the article by Sanjay Sarma, Sarma addresses the widespread security concerns that have been associated with an increasingly connected society. Sarma breaks these concerns into 3 major issues: Agreement on system architecture, Development of open standards reflecting the best architectural choices, Creation of a “test bed” where best practices can be designed and perfected. He posits that as long as the main issues are addresed as IOT continues to develop, then the negative aspects of IOT can be reigned in.

- Quote: "our glorious future of flying cars and convenience was somehow switched out for umbrellas that tweet us when it’s going to rain, and a fridge that live streams its contents. How did the Jetsons become so lame?"
- Comment: I think it's interesting to consider how societal expectations influence the acceptance or rejection of certain technologies. And although its done in jest I think this is a piece of what Internet of Shit is getting at.
- Question: How can existing IOT technologies be made to conform retroactively to developing standards?


### Experiment 1: Taste the Power

1. ![IMG_9852](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51386595/153117848-9e258e1e-eda2-419b-b847-ca0386a2f2a4.jpg)

1. Most important: Though the design has changed and been updated over the years the basic way we use multimeters has remained the same over the years
1. Quiz question: What is the difference between an auto range meter and a manual range meter?

### Experiment 2: Abuse a Battery

1. Text, photos, notes

   - Using the water analogy, the narowness of a tank/pipe is resistance, water pressure is voltage, and the flow of the water is the currrent so: water pressure = flow *      narowness
  
   - Charge is measured in couloumbs, voltage in volts and current in Amperes
  
   -  3 differences between DC and AC are the direction the current flows in each, DC is not capable of traveling the long distances that AC is, Its easier to generate AC power than it is DC power
  
1. Quiz question: Why is it easier to generate AC power than it is DC power

### Experiment #3: Your First Circuit

1. Text, photos, etc.
![thumbnail_IMG_9853](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51386595/153123054-0045b6c1-13fa-42d1-8e2e-7b825dbff5be.jpg)


  - Its often easiest to read the bag when trying to determine resistance
  - When measuring the voltage through a basic circuit the multimeter reads about 4.7 volts, it reads about the same when the resistor is included in the circuit further verifying Ohm's law
