## Week 1

### Tom Igoe, Physicality and Conviviality 

In the TEDxBigApple video by Tom Igoe, Igoe describes the nature of physical computing and how a broadening of the physical computing landscape is accompanying a shift in computational culture. He describes how companies and creators are moving towards different models of innovation.  As a result of this shift a lot of major technologies are becoming open source, creators and innovators are flocking to maker spaces and companies are incentivized to make their products modifiable.

- Quote: "users download plans or buy them from their typical companies and add more value to the items their buying by customizing them".
- Comment: I think it's interesting that Igoe believes conusmers/creators are adding more value to the products by customizing them, typically large tech leaders don't encourage this kind of iteration on their products because of the demands it places on the companies devlopment methodologies (e.g. Apple and their developer regulations)
- Question: What are some ways that companies can effectively make this shift to allowing innovation to flow both ways?


## Week 2


### Internet of Shit, The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours
In the article by Internet of Shit, Internet of Shit describes the staggerng number of ways an increasingly IOT trending society could fail or create more problems than it solves. Internet of Shit gives a number of examples of this including the horror of in-app purchase possibly being incorporated into essential technologies like thermostats and refrigeration. Ultimately Internet of Shit believes some of these technologies have their place in the world however for them to be completely effective will require commitments from manufacturers that are not quite yet in place. 

### Sanjay Sarma, The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World 
In the article by Sanjay Sarma, Sarma addresses the widespread security concerns that have been associated with an increasingly connected society. Sarma breaks these concerns into 3 major issues: Agreement on system architecture, Development of open standards reflecting the best architectural choices, Creation of a “test bed” where best practices can be designed and perfected. He posits that as long as the main issues are addresed as IOT continues to develop, then the negative aspects of IOT can be reigned in.

- Quote: "our glorious future of flying cars and convenience was somehow switched out for umbrellas that tweet us when it’s going to rain, and a fridge that live streams its contents. How did the Jetsons become so lame?"
- Comment: I think it's interesting to consider how societal expectations influence the acceptance or rejection of certain technologies. And although its done in jest I think this is a piece of what Internet of Shit is getting at.
- Question: How can existing IOT technologies be made to conform retroactively to developing standards?


### Experiment 1: Taste the Power

1. ![IMG_9852](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51386595/153117848-9e258e1e-eda2-419b-b847-ca0386a2f2a4.jpg)

1. Most important: Though the design has changed and been updated over the years the basic way we use multimeters has remained the same over the years
1. Quiz question: What is the difference between an auto range meter and a manual range meter?

### Experiment 2: Abuse a Battery

1. Text, photos, notes

   - Using the water analogy, the narowness of a tank/pipe is resistance, water pressure is voltage, and the flow of the water is the currrent so: water pressure = flow *      narowness
  
   - Charge is measured in couloumbs, voltage in volts and current in Amperes
  
   -  3 differences between DC and AC are the direction the current flows in each, DC is not capable of traveling the long distances that AC is, Its easier to generate AC power than it is DC power
  
1. Quiz question: Why is it easier to generate AC power than it is DC power

### Experiment #3: Your First Circuit

1. Text, photos, etc.


![thumbnail_IMG_9853](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51386595/153123054-0045b6c1-13fa-42d1-8e2e-7b825dbff5be.jpg)


  - Its often easiest to read the bag when trying to determine resistance
  - When measuring the voltage through a basic circuit the multimeter reads about 4.7 volts, it reads about the same when the resistor is included in the circuit further verifying Ohm's law
  - There are numerous places along the circuit at which a voltage measurement can be taken
3. Most important: Always be careful when dealing with current 
4. Quiz question: Why does an LED burnout?

### Experiment #4

1. Text, photos, etc

  ![potentiometer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51386595/153124511-88536dde-01dd-42ce-8ac7-a398fcee0caa.jpg)

  - Polarity generally describes the directional flow of electrons from one pole to another
  - The current and voltage measurements throughout the components of the cirrcuit can all be related by measuring the resistance of the wires and utilinz mathematical calculations 
  - Ohm's law V = I * R
  - creating circuits in series or parallel affects the value of certain measurements in a circuit depending on the components being connected.
  - Circuits in series mean that if one unit of the circuit burns out the entire circuit will fail
4. Quiz question: How do you calculate total current in parallel?


## Week 4

### Phillip K Dick, Pay for the Printer
In Pay for the Printer by Phillip K Dick, Dick describes a world in which creating from scratch has become a rarity. A mysterious machine known as the Biltong(which has striking similarities to a 3d printer)is responsible for the development of all new items in the original. It accomplishes this by way of a process known as printing new copies from originals (or orignally made items/very realistic copies). By the end of the story, however, 2 of the main characters figure out that they can create the same items they need from scratch they just need to rebuild the architecture necessary to do so. Dick's story hints at the danger in futuristic processes like 3d printing where items possibly no longer have the same level of quality or end up requiring more labor in the long run to maintain.

### THE PRESERVING MACHINE

The main protagonist Doc Labyrinth fears for the safety of the fragile works of great value, particularly classical music, in the event of the apocalypse. Accordingly, he orders a machine to be built that will be able to convert musical scores into animals capable of surviving and defending themselves.

- Quote:"I said good night and got into my car. It was pitch dark; nighthad fallen completely. I switched on my headlights and moved off down the road, driving into the utter darkness. There were no other cars in sight anywhere. I was alone, and very cold. "
- Comment: It was interesting the way that the main character described the music which ended up being produced by the preserving machine. The result seemed a bit anti-climatic given that entire protagonist main dreams and wishes were predicated on their abiity to replicate this high value music.
- Question: What does the symbol of the dung beetle mean in the context of this story?




## Week 5

### Everything That’s Inside Your iPhone
Within the article Everything That's Inside Your iPhone Brian Merchant describes the nuanced process by which the materials for an Apple iPhone are gathered and prepared. The author seeks to provide the reader with a window into the composition of the iPhone at its most foundational level.

- Quote: "Michaud writes, "aluminum and iron were the most abundant metals in the phone accounting for 38.5 percent of the iPhone mass. Other metals, such as copper, cobalt, chromium, and nickel accounted for 17.1 percent of the mass. Lithium was measured to be about 0.67 percent of the iPhone mass. Other elements of interest were carbon, at 15.4 percent, and silicon at 6.3 percent. There's even a trace amount of arsenic in the phone, though not enough to be toxic."
- Comment: I was shocked at the variety of materials that are needed to develop the apple iPhone as well as the variety of places from which these materials are sourced from. It was very interesting to me that one of their tour guides also worked part-time as an elementary school teacher, a combination I've never encountered before.
- Question: Are there steps being taken to remove the damage done in areas like the toxic waste lake, within inner Mongolia?

### One Man's Nearly Impossible Quest to Make a Toaster From Scratch
In One Man's Nearly Imposssible Quest to Make a Toaster From Scratch Rachel Swaby describes how designer Thomas Thwaites decides to build a toaster from scratch. Thwaites cycles through a number of different materials ranging from commercial level quality resources to raw materials out of earth.

- Quote: "Michaud writes, "aluminum and iron were the most abundant metals in the phone accounting for 38.5 percent of the iPhone mass. Other metals, such as copper, cobalt, chromium, and nickel accounted for 17.1 percent of the mass. Lithium was measured to be about 0.67 percent of the iPhone mass.

   Do you need to secure some kind of license to be able to purchase the kind of materials and equipment that the main character uses throughout the article.

## Week 6

### Igloo White
In _Igloo White_ John T. Correll describes the seeding of the Ho Chinh Minh Trail with 20000 sensors in Vietnam. The trail was a major route way for supplies, troops and weapons over the duration of the war. Correll also highlights the role that the secretary of defense Robert S. McNamara played in developing and implementing the military strategy of the time interdiction.

- Quote: "Before, the enemy had two things going for him. The sun went down every night, and he had trees to hide under. Now he
has nothing.”"

- Comment: I am shocked that the United States committed to such a large scale operation that had a relatively limited chance of success. With the amount of variables that the troops within the terrain would have to adjust for and the possibility of missing trails or hidden paths it appears to be a very large rash commmitment. This is exacerbated by the fact that initial readings from the sensors were not favorable, however, the operation was kept active.
  
- Question: Why did the government continue this operation after confirming that there were a number of paths for which sensor paths were not laid out for?

## Week 7

### Unseen Sensors Constantly Sensing but Rarely Seen
In _Unseen Sensors Constantly Sensing but Rarely Seen_ Mayo Nissen describes 

- Quote: "They’re everywhere. We attach them to our wrists, embed them into our medical devices, and mount them onto the lampposts that dot every block of our city. Some sensing technologies capture our imagination and attract our constant attention. Yet many go unnoticed, their insides packed with unknowable electronic components, ceaselessly counting, measuring, and transmitting. For what purpose, or to whose gain, is often unclear."

- Comment: "It was shocking to me that items on the internet are still capable of existing there forever given the things we've learned about privacy as a society. I believed that by this juncture in society legislation would have been passed to regulate occurrences like this.
  
- Question: Given the stage of development these machines have reached, as well as their level of immersion within society, it too late for comprehensive and effective legislation to be passed that would regulate the reach of these ubiquitous machines?
