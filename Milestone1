### Milestone 1

During this time I was a bit uncertain about the directon in which I wanted my idea to go so I spent some more time chatting with Brady  
about the possible limitations of the project I was pursuing. I also spent some time chatting with you(Professor Mundy) about the possible ways to 
make the project idea relevant to the viewers/more interactive. Thanks to your suggestions I arrived at the idea that a monitor that read the color 
of the persons shirt once they entered the frame and played a song corresponding to the warmth of their shirt would be what I would pursue.
Having made this decision I began to scan through various open source computer vision software in an effort to select the one that would most 
aptly suit my purposes. Aside from that I also began looking through different types of color sensors to see which one would be best for the imagined task.
